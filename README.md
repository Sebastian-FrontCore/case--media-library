# Media Library Case Study

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:push
pnpm db:seed
pnpm dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/acme-co/media` to begin.

## Tasks

This is a media library for managing images across different organizations. The foundation is in place — your tasks are to:

1. Let users update the name and descriptions of media files
2. Add pagination and sorting to the media list
3. Implement deletion of media files
4. Share any thoughts on how you'd approach this differently or changes you'd make to the existing code

Explore the codebase and prepare to discuss your approach in the interview. Walk us through how you'd structure the solution, explain tradeoffs, and show your thinking. Write code if it helps you explain, but we only care about your thought process.
